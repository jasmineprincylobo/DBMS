*************Steps S#to create new user in mysql******************************
To use the cookingRecipe db follow these steps
*************
mysql -u jaslobo -p -h localhost
Enter password: jas
use  cookingRecipe;
create tables.............
***********
 	

I solved in this way: I logged in with root username

mysql -u root -p -h localhost

I created a new user with

CREATE USER 'francesco'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';

*****CREATE USER 'jaslobo'@'localhost' identified by 'jas';

****  username:jaslobo
      password:jas   *********
then I created the database
'
CREATE DATABASE shop;
***** create database cookingRecipe;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)



I granted privileges for new user for this database

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON shop.* TO 'francesco'@'localhost';

Then I logged out root and logged in new user

quit;
mysql -u francesco -p -h localhost

I rebuilt my database using a script

source shop.sql;


And that's it.. Now from php works without problems with the call

 $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "francesco", "some_pass", "shop");

Thanks to all for your time :)
